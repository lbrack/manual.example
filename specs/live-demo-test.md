# Live Demo Test
This **example test** is used to verify that our **live demo** is still working. Sometimes it breaks! The focus of the demo is to 
showcase how automated results can be managed with Testspace. There are **10 Steps** to the demo, each with 
there own `Bubble container`.  Because this test is *mostly a visual validation* we decided to use **setup fixturing**, versus 
repeating the same instructions. 

To start the demo go here: https://demo.testspace.com.  

The objective of the test is to (i) Confirm each of the Steps correctly position the bubble container (ii) Check the blog links and 
(iii) Steps transitions correctly. 

The following `unordered list` are **setup fixturing** steps for each scenario (test case):


* Bubble **completely** visible and positioned in a reasonable location
* If a **blog link** exists it opens to a new tab and displays a valid article 
* The **Next** button transitions correctly to the following step
