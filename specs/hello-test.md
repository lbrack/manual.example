# Hello Test
This is a simple example showing how to create scenarios (aka `test cases`). 

## My First Test Case 
Can add any text you want here, providing some context for the test. 
The important item is to list specific **steps** to guide the validation.

 * Check **THIS** out
 * Next, check **THAT** out
 

## My Second Test Case
The same process for the second test case, adding the test context. This example also
uses a code block.


Run utility before starting (for example)
<pre>
$ git pull origin big-branch
</pre>

 * Step one defined here 
 * More steps; can list as many as required

## My Third Test Case
This example does **not** use steps, just a simple table showing different configurations.
